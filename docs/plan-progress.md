# Emulator and Light Touch plan progress

The workstream follows the supplied hardware-fidelity plan, with reproducible
storage corruption promoted ahead of new peripherals. Each completed item needs
both a focused regression and relevant guest evidence. Bluetooth peers and
TV-out were explicitly deferred by that plan.

| Track | Status | Acceptance evidence still needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generated NAND integrity and restart stability | Complete for the reproduced failures: free-pool bounds, FMSS completion, VIC fixes and paced TV-out IRQs | Twelve alternating Coldplay/Spore install/respring cycles; unchanged system file; guest shutdown; cold boot with both apps; full-volume read-only fsck passed |
| PMU ADC and masked event IRQ | Complete | Ten-bit results, settling vs conversion, mask/read-to-clear and GPIO tests pass; real 7E18 boot, three lock/wake cycles and native shutdown pass |
| Battery controls | Core implemented and guest verified; Light Touch integration pending | 20/60 percent cold calibration, full-voltage estimate, runtime off/on/auto and native shutdown pass; preserve guest filtering delay |
| Headset/Mikey detection | Deferred at user request (2026-09-05) | Plug/unplug and headset button traces; correct guest routing |
| Microphone/I2S RX | Deferred at user request (2026-09-05) | Deterministic input tone captured by the guest, then host microphone recording |
| Native idle sleep/wake | Pending | Auto-lock, actual display/CPU sleep, power/Home wake without brightness overrides |
| Kernel serial console | Complete: explicit machine arguments, live console regression and Light Touch control build pass | Include the updated control in the final package verification |
| Settings Wi-Fi join | Deferred at user request (2026-09-05) | Manual join without known-network seed or alert loop; DHCP and traffic |
| Two-instance LAN | Deferred at user request (2026-09-05) | Separate identities, MACs and state; bidirectional traffic between guests |
| Hardware shortcuts | FMSS completion and TV-out frame timing fixed; VIC daisy-chain defects fixed; DSI panel reply queue implemented | PKE, NOR persistence, FMSS erase, remaining LCD/TV-out status and AES matching review |
| Light Touch integration | Original UI fixes committed | Package and verify the resulting hardware controls and readiness/recovery paths |
| Bluetooth peers / TV-out | Deferred per supplied plan | No implementation claimed |

See [UI reliability](ipod-ui-reliability.md) for the original fixes and the
storage reproduction. Temporary `/tmp` paths there identify local evidence;
they are not dependencies of the committed tests.

## User priority update (2026-09-05)

Finish the frame-polling crash fix, non-quitting Power Off/On, sleep/off visuals,
and foreground-app subtitle first. Then implement HTTP proxy configuration with
WaybackProxy integration, followed by screen capture/recording, Live Text and
optional touch/finger overlays (using WireView as a reference), then resume the
remaining active plan. Headset/microphone, Settings Wi-Fi join and two-instance
LAN are deferred by explicit user request.

## Proxy and capture follow-up

- Frame-poll startup crash fixed and sanitizer-tested (`074da22b44`).
- Non-quitting Power Off/On, sleep/off visuals and foreground subtitle built
  and native power cycles verified (`460d062`, `7c3cdae801`).
- HTTP proxy: direct host HTTP and external WaybackProxy routing implemented.
  Native NSURLConnection through guestfwd returned HTTP 200 for an unresolvable
  origin using a controlled upstream fixture; reversible configd preferences
  passed on/on/off/off. Host sanitizer tests cover HTTP framing and tunnels.
  WaybackProxy is an external server; archive availability is not claimed tested.
  Modern TLS termination remains a later phase.
- Screen recording/capture, Live Text and finger overlays are in progress.
