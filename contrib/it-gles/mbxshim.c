/*
 * mbxshim -- a drop-in replacement for
 * /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGLES.framework/MBXGLEngine.bundle
 *
 * The stock bundle drives the PowerVR MBX through IOKit. This one forwards
 * every GL call to QEMU instead, where a real host OpenGL context executes it.
 * No IOKit, no AppleMBX, no MBX register contract.
 *
 * WHAT THE FRAMEWORK ACTUALLY REQUIRES OF US
 *
 * All of it was read out of the device's own MBXGLEngine, not assumed. Verified
 * against REAL HARDWARE 2026-08-05: the binary pulled off a physical iPod touch
 * 2G (MB528, build 7E18) is md5 92ddd55fc2968356835760b0ec9b4a15, and that is
 * byte-identical to the ARMV6 SLICE of the 3.1.3 SDK copy. Note the slice: the
 * SDK ships a fat armv6+armv7 bundle (549232 bytes, md5 90c5c928...), so a
 * whole-file comparison against the device's 299648 bytes differs and looks
 * alarming. `lipo -thin armv6` first.
 *
 *   - The bundle exports exactly ONE symbol, _GLESGetEGLInterface. Everything
 *     else reaches us through the table it returns. `nm -gU` on the real binary
 *     shows 43 exports and the only GLES* one is that.
 *
 *   - GLESGetEGLInterface is three instructions: return &table. The table is
 *     nine function pointers, then pairs of {const char *extension, u32 bit}.
 *     3.1.3's framework never indexes past the ninth pointer; 4.2.1's (8C148)
 *     reads two more, Set/GetProperty (see GLESSetProperty).
 *
 *   - GLESCreateGC(sharegroup, X+0x10, X+0xCE8, X+0xC) is called from
 *     -[EAGLContext initWithAPI:properties:] on a 6592-byte calloc'd block X.
 *     The real one callocs a 5440-byte GC, stores its two pointer arguments
 *     inside that GC, writes the GC through its FOURTH argument (`str r5,[r11]`
 *     at 0x9b40), and RETURNS 1 ON SUCCESS, 0 on failure.
 *
 *     That return value is easy to get backwards, and getting it backwards
 *     costs a whole debug cycle: -[EAGLContext initWithAPI:] simply hands back
 *     nil, after our bundle has been loaded and all three of our entry points
 *     called, so every log line looks healthy. The success path is not the
 *     function's fall-through epilogue -- that one is `mov r0,#0` and is the
 *     failure exit. Success leaves through `cmp r0,#1; beq` at 0x9de8, where
 *     the comparison itself has already put 1 in r0 and the branch just runs
 *     into the pop. Reading only the epilogue makes it look like every path
 *     returns 0.
 *
 *   - X+0x10 is the dispatch table the framework's gl* trampolines index. Each
 *     trampoline is six instructions: read the context from TSD key 30, load
 *     the function from ctx+(0x10+slot*4), load the GC from ctx+0xC, tail-call.
 *     So arg0 of every entry point is the GC, and we own every table entry.
 *
 *   - 4.2.1 (8C148) keeps this whole contract with an 841-slot table
 *     (GLESCreateGC(sharegroup, X+0x10, X+0xD34, X+0xC)). The slot layout is
 *     the firmware's __GLIFunctionDispatchRec, read out of the running OpenGLES
 *     at load (gles_dispatch.c), so one binary serves every layout; MBXGLEngine
 *     lives in 4.x's shared cache, so the builder also creates dyld's
 *     enable-dylibs-to-override-cache switch.
 *
 * Build with contrib/it-gles/build.sh (contrib/armv6-toolchain).

/* ------------------------------------------ the CoreAnimation drawable ----
 *
 * THE DRAWABLE IS A CALLBACK TABLE, NOT A BUFFER.
 *
 * This was read out of the stock engine (device copy, md5 92ddd55f, so the
 * addresses below are literal file addresses in it) and it settles what two
 * rounds of guessing could not. GLESBindView never dereferences its drawable as
 * data; it tail-calls through it:
 *
 *   0xd7ec  str  r5, [r4, #0x20c]     ; remember the drawable in the engine ctx
 *   0xd7f4  str  r3, [r4, #0x214]     ; r3 = &_GLESCreateBuffer   (0xda88)
 *   0xd804  str  r4, [r4, #0x210]     ; the engine's own context
 *   0xd808  str  r3, [r4, #0x218]     ; r3 = &_GLESDestroyBuffer  (0xd8dc)
 *   0xd80c  str  r8, [r4, #0x224]     ; the GC
 *   0xd814  mov  r1, r10              ; a pixel-format FourCC
 *   0xd818  add  r2, r4, #528         ; = ctx+0x210, i.e. the block just built
 *   0xd81c  ldr  pc, [r5, #0x4]       ; drawable->bind(drawable, fourcc, block)
 *
 * So the engine hands CoreAnimation a {context, functions} closure and CA calls
 * back into it. `_GLESCreateBuffer(ctx, surface)` at 0xda88 takes the
 * IOSurfaceRef as its SECOND ARGUMENT -- its first instructions are
 * IOSurfaceLock(r1) and _ValidateCoreSurface(r1). That is where the surface
 * comes from. It was never anywhere inside the drawable, which is why looking
 * for it there found nothing.
 *
 * THE FORMAT IS 'BGRA', and now for a reason rather than by assumption. r10
 * above is a FourCC selected from the internalformat argument:
 *
 *   GL_RGB565_OES (0x8d62)                        -> 'L565' (0x4c353635)
 *   GL_RGB8/RGBA4/RGB5_A1/RGBA8 (0x8051..0x8058)  -> 'BGRA' (0x42475241)
 *   0 (unspecified)                               -> 'BGRA'
 *   anything else                                 -> GL_INVALID_ENUM, no bind
 *
 * It is the format the engine ASKS CA for, so for an RGBA8 renderbuffer -- what
 * every CAEAGLLayer client gets by default -- the surface really is BGRA.
 *
 * THE REST OF THE TABLE, and the one that actually delivers a frame:
 *
 *   +0x08 unbind(drawable)          -- releases a binding on teardown/rebind,
 *                                      or if acquiring its first buffer fails.
 *                                      GLESBindView calls _DetachTexture first
 *                                      (7E18 armv6 0xd7dc); _DetachTexture
 *                                      calls unbind at 0x1bee4.
 *   +0x0c nextBuffer(drawable)      -- returns the IOSurfaceRef to render into
 *                                      for THIS frame.
 *   +0x10 present(drawable, 1)      -- the frame in that surface is finished.
 *
 * nextBuffer is the whole answer to "where does the address come from".
 * _ViewTextureBeginIfNeeded (0xd5ec) is the only caller:
 *
 *   0xd5f4  ldr  r3, [r1, #0x21c]   ; nothing to do unless a buffer is wanted
 *   0xd618  ldr  pc, [r3, #0xc]     ; surface = drawable->nextBuffer(drawable)
 *   0xd628  ldr  r2, [r4, #0x230]   ; then look it up in the buffer list that
 *   0xd634  ldr  r3, [r2, #0x18]    ;   _GLESCreateBuffer built
 *   0xd678  str  r0, [r4, #0x220]   ; and arm the present
 *
 * and GLESPresentView re-arms ctx+0x21c on the way out (0xd70c), so it is
 * exactly ONE nextBuffer per frame. That is also the answer to whether CA can
 * move the surface between frames: it does not merely have the right to, the
 * design hands you a different one each frame -- this is double buffering, and
 * caching the address from bind time would render into the buffer being
 * scanned out.
 *
 * bind, present and nextBuffer all report failure as zero (0xd820
 * `subs r5,r0,#0` then `beq` to SetError; 0xd624 likewise), and so does
 * _GLESCreateBuffer (0xdc50 `mov r0,#1` on the success path only).
