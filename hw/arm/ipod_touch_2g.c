 * IT_INJECT_DT: 3.1.3 device-tree bring-up (Option B3).
 *
 * The 7E18 iBoot loads and decrypts the kernelcache from HFS, but then fails to
 * load the device tree: its load_and_set_device_tree() (VA 0x0ff0f498) calls
 * image_load() (VA 0x0ff1998c) on the NOR 'dtre' image, which is rejected at
 * signature validation before any GID decrypt is attempted -- and a global
 * security-state change (forge/demote) to permit it breaks the kernelcache.
 *
 * Instead we hand iBoot an already-decrypted device tree. load_and_set_device_tree
 * (VA 0x0ff0f498) sets its DT-address global (g_dt_addr @ 0x0ff27560) to
 * 0x0BF00000 and its DT-size global (g_dt_size @ 0x0ff27564) to the enumerated
 * image size *before* the image_load() call; on image_load() success it returns
 * those to the caller, which then dt_deserialize()s the blob at g_dt_addr into
 * iBoot's node list (the list UpdateDeviceTree/AllocateMemoryRange walk).
 *
 * iBoot zeroes DRAM (both the insecure 0x08000000 and secure 0x0B000000 banks)
 * during early init, so a device tree dropped at 0x0BF00000 at reset is gone long
 * before the DT load. But the "llb"/SRAM region at 0x22000000 is NOT cleared (it
 * is where the SecureROM/LLB run on real hardware) and iBoot keeps it mapped. So
 * we stage the decrypted serialized device tree at 0x22000000 and rewrite the
 * failing image_load() call site (VA 0x0ff0f4da) into a 16-byte thunk that copies
 * the blob into place right when the DT is loaded (after the kernelcache
 * decompress that would otherwise clobber it):
 *
 *     movs r0,#0xbf ; lsls r0,r0,#20      ; r0 = 0x0BF00000 (dst = g_dt_addr)
 *     movs r1,#0x22 ; lsls r1,r1,#24      ; r1 = 0x22000000 (src = staging)
 *     ldr  r2,[r5]                        ; r2 = g_dt_size  (len, already set)
 *     blx  0x0ff1b474                     ; iBoot memcpy(dst, src, len)
 *     b    0x0ff0f4ea                     ; fall into the success/out-param path
 *
 * memcpy preserves r4/r5/r6/r8, so the function's success tail returns g_dt_addr
 * and g_dt_size to the caller exactly as a real image_load would. This touches
 * ONLY the dtre path; the kernelcache still validates and decrypts normally, and

 * what the "type logo offset 0x495c0" line in the boot log reports. The load

 * image_load that rejects the dtre, failing personalised-signature validation
 * before any GID decrypt is attempted -- confirmed by the AES engine, which
 * performs exactly one GID operation in a whole boot ("7E18 kernelcache") and
 * never one for the logo. Unlike the device tree, a failed picture load is
 * silent: do_boot_ui simply paints its black background and boots on.
 *
 * So do for the logo what IT_INJECT_DT does for the device tree: hand iBoot the
 * already-decrypted image and skip the validation it cannot pass. The call site
 * is retargeted to a thunk that fills in the two out-parameters and returns 0.
 * On the success path iBoot itself checks the blob, so the staged file must be
 * a real decrypted iBootIm container ("iBootIm\0", 'lzss', 'argb' or 'grey');
 * iBoot decompresses and blits it. imgtools/extract_bootlogo.py produces one.
 *
 * Only this one call site is touched, so the kernelcache still validates and
 * decrypts normally -- unlike IT_FORGE_SIGCHECK, which is global and breaks it
 * ("Kernelcache image not valid" -> recovery mode).

 *   at 0x22000000 at logo time. Put the image there, clear of the DT.
 *
 * - The thunk cannot go there too: a Thumb BL only reaches +/-16 MB and
 *   0x22000000 is ~318 MB from the call site. It has to live inside the loaded
 *   iBoot image, which is not zeroed. do_recoverymode_ui (the 'recm' UI at
 *   0x0ff00cfe) is dead code in a normal boot -- nothing calls it unless iBoot
 *   enters recovery -- so the thunk goes there. If a future change ever needs
 *   recovery mode's UI with IT_INJECT_LOGO set, move this.

 *
 * amfi_allow_any_signature forgives code-page validation at exec, so a decrypted
 * (Clutch) app *runs* -- but it does not confer platform-binary status. When
 * SpringBoard spawns an app it then reaches for the child's task port to wire up
 * the app before resuming it (task_name_for_pid -> mac_proc_check_get_task_name);
 * AMFI's policy hook grants that only for a validly-signed binary, so for a
 * decrypted app SpringBoard logs "Failed to spawn ...: Unable to obtain a task
 * name port right ... (os/kern) failure" and kills it (exit 1). No AMFI
 * enforcement-disable boot-arg relaxes this path (amfi_allow_any_signature /
 * cs_enforcement_disable / amfi_get_out_of_my_way / amfi_unrestrict_task_for_pid
 * were all tried; the failure is identical), and get-task-allow on the target
 * does not help either.
 *
 * The single kernel choke points are the MAC framework's
 *   mac_proc_check_get_task_name (VA 0xc01ab2a0) and
 *   mac_proc_check_get_task      (VA 0xc01ab200)
 * which task_name_for_pid / task_for_pid consult; a zero return means "allowed".
 * We patch each prologue to `movs r0,#0 ; bx lr` so every task-port request is
 * granted, exactly as it is for a platform binary. This is the userspace-signing
 * analog of amfi_allow_any_signature and, like IT_BOOT_ARGS, it lives entirely in
 * the emulator -- no image edits, and it applies to any app however it arrived
 * (offline injection or over-the-wire install). The kernelcache is decrypted in
 * DRAM (VA->phys slide 0xB8000000: VA 0xC0000000 == phys 0x08000000), so the
 * code bytes are patchable from the host once the kernel image is present; we
