# QEMU-iOS

This is a fork of [devos50/qemu-ios](https://github.com/devos50/qemu-ios),
targeting an emulated **iPod touch 2G (n72ap) running iOS 3.1.3**. It boots to
an interactive home screen, runs real 2008-era App Store apps (including
OpenGL ES 1.1 games — see `docs/capabilities.md`), talks to `libimobiledevice`
over an emulated USB link, and persists guest writes across reboots. See
`docs/capabilities.md` for the full, currently-accurate list of what works and
where it stops.

## Build

```sh
../configure --enable-sdl --target-list=arm-softmmu --disable-capstone --disable-pie --disable-slirp --disable-fuse \
    --extra-cflags=-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/include --extra-ldflags='-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/lib -lcrypto'
ninja -C build qemu-system-arm
```

(Apple Silicon Homebrew paths shown; see `RUNNING.md` for other platforms and
build troubleshooting.)

## Run

```sh
contrib/run-ipod-touch.sh
```

This is the in-repo launcher; run `contrib/run-ipod-touch.sh --help` for the
full flag list (installing apps, USB/networking, audio, headless QMP driving,
etc). It expects the 3.1.3 release images under `~/Developer/qemu-ios-files`
(override with `IPOD_FILES`) — these are not included in this repository.

The native macOS frontend is the sibling `LightTouchMac` repository. Its
README and `scripts/build-package-native.sh` / `scripts/package.sh` describe
the current self-contained build. `contrib/macos-app/build-app.sh` is the older
launcher packaging pipeline.

QEMU-iOS is an emulator for legacy Apple devices.
Currently, the iPod Touch 1G and iPod Touch 2G are supported.

The schematic below shows the most important hardware components of the iPod Touch 2G and their interactions.
The schematic for the iPod Touch 1G is mostly similar.
