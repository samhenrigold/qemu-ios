# Does a byte handed to a UART chardev actually reach guest memory?
#
# It did not, for the whole life of this tree, and nothing noticed because
# nothing was ever connected to a UART's input. Two bugs stacked: the Rx DMA
# REQUEST line was never driven (hw/arm/ipod_touch_2g.c), and UCON[1:0]==11b --
# what the S5L8720 uses to select DMA -- was decoded as "not DMA"
# (hw/char/exynos4210_uart.c). The guest's Bluetooth driver arms a 2048-byte
# peripheral->memory channel on UART1's URXH and never reads the register
# itself, so replies sat in the Rx FIFO forever.
#
# The check: boot with the Bluetooth HCI model on UART1 and observe the final
# BCM Launch RAM request. Reaching it requires the guest to accept preceding
# HCI replies through the Rx DMA path.
#
#     tests/ipod/bluetooth-bringup-check.sh [nand-image] [boots]
#
# It boots the guest `boots` times (default 3, resetting in between) and
# requires bring-up EVERY time. One pass proves nothing here: the failures this
# guards are races, and they present as "Bluetooth worked yesterday and says
# unavailable today, and app launches stopped animating with it".
#
# Passing proves the firmware-download script reached BCM Launch RAM on each
# boot. It does not prove BluetoothManager readiness or app-launch animation.
