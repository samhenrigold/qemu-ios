"""Regression harness for the emulated iPod touch 2G.

Every check here corresponds to a bug that actually shipped in this tree, so
none of them is a smoke test: "did it boot?" would have missed all of them.

  boot        SpringBoard reaches the home screen, judged from the *framebuffer*
              and not from a serial banner. A machine that prints the whole boot
              log and then shows a black screen is a regression the log cannot
              see. The panel's samples are very dark, so the frame is counted by
              lit sub-pixels rather than looked at: the boot logo is around 10k
              lit and the home screen around 290k, so the two are impossible to
              confuse.
  afc         Push and pull files over AFC and compare SHA-256, at sizes that
              are deliberately *not* multiples of 512. A residue bug in the USB
              bulk-IN path corrupted exactly the trailing partial packet, and
              round, 512-aligned test files never saw it.
  usbtcp      TCP-over-USB forwarding: iproxy to lockdownd on 62078 and a real
              lockdown QueryType round trip. This exercises the mux's stream
              layer rather than a one-shot service request.
  wifi        The BCM4325 model associates ("AirPort: Link Up on en0") *and* the
              guest takes a DHCP lease - checked on the wire, from the netdev
              capture, because a carrier with no lease looks identical in the log.
  appinstall  ideviceinstaller installs a decrypted App Store app and it appears
              in the installed list.
  applaunch   Launch the installed IPA's bundle ID through SpringBoard, then
              verify that exact foreground app and a lit screen. Requires
              appinstall, guest SSH, and built contrib/it-gles/sblaunch.
  persist     A file written over AFC survives a *clean* shutdown and a reboot on
              the same overlay, byte-identical. HFS+ holds catalog updates in
              memory, so killing QEMU loses the directory entry while keeping the
              data blocks: the file silently ceases to exist. Only a
              system_powerdown unmounts the volume.
  serial-console
              Enable early serial boot arguments and require XNU driver output
              and the BSD root mount in serial.log (explicit --checks only).
  fsck        The base image composed with the overlay fscks clean, i.e. the
              persisted pages landed on the physical pages the FTL mapping says
              they should.

Usage:
    tests/ipod/regress.py                    # default tier: boot, fsck, persist, appinstall, applaunch, gles, agent, audio
    tests/ipod/regress.py --with-apps         # + afc, usbtcp, wifi, appinstall, applaunch
    tests/ipod/regress.py --quick            # boot + afc only, one boot
    tests/ipod/regress.py --checks boot,wifi # explicit selection, any tier
    tests/ipod/regress.py --check-prereqs    # report missing artefacts, run nothing

The default tier needs a built qemu-system-arm and a NAND containing it_agent.
USB-side checks need the usbmuxd fork (--usbmuxd); missing host tools cause an
individual SKIP. A present image whose agent fails to start is a failure.
App checks use the bundled Harness.ipa by default; --ipa selects another app.

Exits non-zero if any selected check FAILs (SKIP and XFAIL do not count).

Known, reproducible interaction: appinstall run after afc in the same boot
fails - installd resets the mux connection mid-install
("Install: ExtractingPackage (15%)"), no app is registered, and
`ideviceinstaller` hangs in idevice_wait_for_command_to_complete for a
completion status that never comes, because it has no timeout of its own.
An app installs and launches perfectly on a device that has done nothing
else first. --install-timeout bounds the hang so the rest of the suite still
runs. This historical failure is still a FAIL: running AFC first is not
proof that a later installation failure has the same cause.
